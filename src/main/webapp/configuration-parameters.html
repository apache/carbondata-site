<td>carbon.ddl.base.hdfs.url</td>
<td>(none)</td>
<td>To simplify and shorten the path to be specified in DDL/DML commands, this property is supported. This property is used to configure the HDFS relative path, the path configured in carbon.ddl.base.hdfs.url will be appended to the HDFS path configured in fs.defaultFS of core-site.xml. If this path is configured, then user need not pass the complete path while dataload. For example: If absolute path of the csv file is hdfs://10.18.101.155:54310/data/cnbc/2016/xyz.csv, the path "hdfs://10.18.101.155:54310" will come from property fs.defaultFS and user can configure the /data/cnbc/ as carbon.ddl.base.hdfs.url. Now while dataload user can specify the csv path as /2016/xyz.csv.</td>

<td>48</td>
<td>In order to support parallel data loading onto the same table, CarbonData sequences(locks) at the granularity of segments. Operations affecting the segment(like IUD, alter) are blocked from parallel operations. This property value indicates the number of hours the segment lock files will be preserved after dataload. These lock files will be deleted with the clean command after the configured number of hours.</td>

<tr>
<td>carbon.timestamp.format</td>
<td>yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss</td>
<td>CarbonData can understand data of timestamp type and process it in special manner. It can be so that the format of Timestamp data is different from that understood by CarbonData by default. This configuration allows users to specify the format of Timestamp in their data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.lock.type</td>
<td>LOCALLOCK</td>
<td>This configuration specifies the type of lock to be acquired during concurrent operations on table. There are following types of lock implementation: - LOCALLOCK: Lock is created on local file system as file. This lock is useful when only one spark driver (thrift server) runs on a machine and no other CarbonData spark application is launched concurrently. - HDFSLOCK: Lock is created on HDFS file system as file. This lock is useful when multiple CarbonData spark applications are launched and no ZooKeeper is running on cluster and HDFS supports file based locking.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.update.sync.folder</td>
<td>/tmp/carbondata</td>
<td>CarbonData maintains last modification time entries in modifiedTime.htmlt to determine the schema changes and reload only when necessary. This configuration specifies the path where the file needs to be written.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.invisible.segments.preserve.count</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>CarbonData maintains each data load entry in tablestatus file. The entries from this file are not deleted for those segments that are compacted or dropped, but are made invisible. If the number of data loads are very high, the size and number of entries in tablestatus file can become too many causing unnecessary reading of all data. This configuration specifies the number of segment entries to be maintained afte they are compacted or dropped. Beyond this, the entries are moved to a separate history tablestatus file. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The entries in tablestatus file help to identify the operations performed on CarbonData table and is also used for checkpointing during various data manupulation operations. This is similar to AUDIT file maintaining all the operations and its status. Hence the entries are never deleted but moved to a separate history file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.lock.retries</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>CarbonData ensures consistency of operations by blocking certain operations from running in parallel. In order to block the operations from running in parallel, lock is obtained on the table. This configuration specifies the maximum number of retries to obtain the lock for any operations other than load. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Data manupulation operations like Compaction,UPDATE,DELETE  or LOADING,UPDATE,DELETE are not allowed to run in parallel. How ever data loading can happen in parallel to compaction.</td>
</tr>

<td>This parameter configures which day of the week to be considered as first day of the week. Because first day of the week will be different in different parts of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.enable.tablestatus.backup</td>
<td>false</td>
<td>In cloud object store scenario, overwriting table status file is not an atomic operation since it uses rename API. Thus, it is possible that table status is corrupted if process crashed when overwriting the table status file. To protect from file corruption, user can enable this property.</td>

<td>carbon.concurrent.lock.retries</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>CarbonData supports concurrent data loading onto same table. To ensure the loading status is correctly updated into the system,locks are used to sequence the status updation step. This configuration specifies the maximum number of retries to obtain the lock for updating the load status. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This value is high as more number of concurrent loading happens,more the chances of not able to obtain the lock when tried. Adjust this value according to the number of concurrent loading to be supported by the system.</td>

<td>carbon.skip.empty.line</td>
<td>false</td>
<td>The csv files givent to CarbonData for loading can contain empty lines. Based on the business scenario, this empty line might have to be ignored or needs to be treated as NULL value for all columns. In order to define this business behavior, this configuration is provided. <strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to consider NULL values for non string columns and continue with data load, <em><strong>carbon.bad.records.action</strong></em> need to be set to <strong>FORCE</strong>;else data load will be failed as bad records encountered.</td>
</tr>

<td>carbon.number.of.cores.while.loading</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Number of cores to be used while loading data. This also determines the number of threads to be used to read the input files (csv) in parallel. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This configured value is used in every data loading step to parallelize the operations. Configuring a higher value can lead to increased early thread pre-emption by OS and there by reduce the overall performance.</td>
</tr>

<td>enable.unsafe.sort</td>
<td>true</td>
<td>CarbonData supports unsafe operations of Java to avoid GC overhead for certain operations. This configuration enables to use unsafe functions in CarbonData. <strong>NOTE:</strong> For operations like data loading, which generates more short lived Java objects, Java GC can be a bottle neck. Using unsafe can overcome the GC overhead and improve the overall performance.</td>

<td>carbon.load.sort.scope</td>
<td>NO_SORT [If sort columns are not specified while creating table] and LOCAL_SORT [If sort columns are specified]</td>
<td>CarbonData can support various sorting options to match the balance between load and query performance. LOCAL_SORT: All the data given to an executor in the single load is fully sorted and written to carbondata files. Data loading performance is reduced a little as the entire data needs to be sorted in the executor. GLOBAL SORT: Entire data in the data load is fully sorted and written to carbondata files. Data loading performance would get reduced as the entire data needs to be sorted. But the query performance increases significantly due to very less false positives and concurrency is also improved. <strong>NOTE 1:</strong> This property will be taken into account only when SORT COLUMNS are specified explicitly while creating table, otherwise it is always NO SORT</td>

<td>CarbonData in addition to identifying the bad records, can take certain actions on such data. This configuration can have four types of actions for bad records namely FORCE, REDIRECT, IGNORE and FAIL. If set to FORCE then it auto-corrects the data by storing the bad records as NULL. If set to REDIRECT then bad records are written to the raw CSV instead of being loaded. If set to IGNORE then bad records are neither loaded nor written to the raw CSV. If set to FAIL then data loading fails if any bad records are found.</td>

The data are read as a group of blocklets which are called blocklet groups. This parameter specifies the size of each blocklet group. Higher value results in better sequential IO access. The minimum value is 16MB, any value lesser than 16MB will reset to the default value (64MB). <strong>NOTE:</strong> Configuring a higher value might lead to poor performance as an entire blocklet group will have to read into memory before processing. For filter queries with limit, it is <strong>not advisable</strong> to have a bigger blocklet size. For aggregation queries which need to return more number of rows, bigger blocklet size is advisable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.sort.file.write.buffer.size</td>
<td>16384</td>
<td>CarbonData sorts and writes data to intermediate files to limit the memory usage. This configuration determines the buffer size to be used for reading and writing such files. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This configuration is useful to tune IO and derive optimal performance. Based on the OS and underlying harddisk type, these values can significantly affect the overall performance. It is ideal to tune the buffer size equivalent to the IO buffer size of the OS. Recommended range is between 10240 and 10485760 bytes.</td>

<tr>
<td>carbon.sort.intermediate.files.limit</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>CarbonData sorts and writes data to intermediate files to limit the memory usage. Before writing the target carbondata file, the records in these intermediate files needs to be merged to reduce the number of intermediate files. This configuration determines the minimum number of intermediate files after which merged sort is applied on them sort the data. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Intermediate merging happens on a separate thread in the background. Number of threads used is determined by <em><strong>carbon.merge.sort.reader.thread</strong></em>. Configuring a low value will cause more time to be spent in merging these intermediate merged files which can cause more IO. Configuring a high value would cause not to use the idle threads to do intermediate sort merges. Recommended range is between 2 and 50.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.merge.sort.reader.thread</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>CarbonData sorts and writes data to intermediate files to limit the memory usage. When the intermediate files reaches <em><strong>carbon.sort.intermediate.files.limit</strong></em>, the files will be merged in another thread pool. This value will control the size of the pool. Each thread will read the intermediate files and do merge sort and finally write the records to another file. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Refer to <em><strong>carbon.sort.intermediate.files.limit</strong></em> for operation description. Configuring smaller number of threads can cause merging slow down over loading process whereas configuring larger number of threads can cause thread contention with threads in other data loading steps. Hence configure a fraction of <em><strong>carbon.number.of.cores.while.loading</strong></em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.merge.sort.prefetch</td>
<td>true</td>
<td>CarbonData writes every <em><strong>carbon.sort.size</strong></em> number of records to intermediate temp files during data loading to ensure memory footprint is within limits.

<td>CarbonData writes every <em><strong>carbon.sort.size</strong></em> number of records to intermediate temp files during data loading to ensure memory footprint is within limits. When <em><strong>enable.unsafe.sort</strong></em> configuration is enabled, instead of using <em><strong>carbon.sort.size</strong></em> which is based on rows count, size occupied in memory is used to determine when to flush data pages to intermediate temp files. This configuration determines the memory to be used for storing data pages in memory. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Configuring a higher value ensures more data is maintained in memory and hence increases data loading performance due to reduced or no IO. Based on the memory availability in the nodes of the cluster, configure the values accordingly.</td>

<td>0</td>
<td>During data loading, some data pages are kept in memory upto memory configured in <em><strong>carbon.sort.storage.inmemory.size.inmb</strong></em> beyond which they are spilled to disk as intermediate temporary sort files. This configuration determines after what percentage data needs to be spilled to disk. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Without this configuration, when the data pages occupy upto configured memory, new data pages would be dumped to disk and old pages are still maintained in disk.</td>
</tr>

<td>carbon.enable.calculate.size</td>
<td>true</td>
<td>
<strong>For Load Operation</strong>: Enabling this property will let carbondata calculate the size of the carbon data file (.carbondata) and the carbon index file (.carbonindex) for each load and update the table status file. <strong>For Describe Formatted</strong>: Enabling this property will let carbondata calculate the total size of the carbon data files and the carbon index files for the each table and display it in describe formatted command. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is useful to determine the overall size of the carbondata table and also get an idea of how the table is growing in order to take up other backup strategy decisions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.cutOffTimestamp</td>
<td>(none)</td>
<td>CarbonData has capability to generate the Dictionary values for the timestamp columns from the data itself without the need to store the computed dictionary values. This configuration sets the start date for calculating the timestamp. Java counts the number of milliseconds from start of "1970-01-01 00:00:00". This property is used to customize the start of position. For example "2000-01-01 00:00:00". <strong>NOTE:</strong> The date must be in the form <em><strong>carbon.timestamp.format</strong></em>. CarbonData supports storing data for upto 68 years. For example, if the cut-off time is 1970-01-01 05:30:00, then data upto 2038-01-01 05:30:00 will be supported by CarbonData.</td>

This configuration specifies the name of compressor to be used to compress the intermediate sort temp files during sort procedure in data loading. The valid values are 'SNAPPY','GZIP','BZIP2','LZ4','ZSTD' and empty. By default, empty means that Carbondata will not compress the sort temp files. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Compressor will be useful if you encounter disk bottleneck. Since the data needs to be compressed and decompressed,it involves additional CPU cycles,but is compensated by the high IO throughput due to less data to be written or read from the disks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>carbon.load.skewedDataOptimization.enabled</td>
<td>false</td>
<td>During data loading,CarbonData would divide the number of blocks equally so as to ensure all executors process same number of blocks. This mechanism satisfies most of the scenarios and ensures maximum parallel processing for optimal data loading performance. In some business scenarios, there might be scenarios where the size of blocks vary significantly and hence some executors would have to do more work if they get blocks containing more data. This configuration enables size based block allocation strategy for data loading. When loading, carbondata will use file size based block allocation strategy for task distribution. It will make sure that all the executors process the same size of data. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This configuration is useful if the size of your input data files varies widely, say 1MB to 1GB. For this configuration to work effectively,knowing the data pattern and size is important and necessary.</td>

<td>CarbonData has extensive logging which would be useful for debugging issues related to performance or hard to locate issues. This configuration when made <em><strong>true</strong></em> would log additional data loading statistics information to more accurately locate the issues being debugged. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Enabling this would log more debug information to log files, there by increasing the log files size significantly in short span of time. It is advised to configure the log files size, retention of log files parameters in log4j properties appropriately. Also extensive logging is an increased IO operation and hence over all data loading performance might get reduced. Therefore it is recommended to enable this configuration only for the duration of debugging.</td>

<td>CarbonData generates dictionary keys and writes them to separate dictionary file during data loading. To optimize the IO, this configuration determines the number of dictionary keys to be persisted to dictionary file at a time. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Writing to file also serves as a commit point to the dictionary generated. Increasing more values in memory causes more data loss during system or application failure. It is advised to alter this configuration judiciously.</td>
</tr>

<td>carbon.load.directWriteToStorePath.enabled</td>
<td>false</td>
<td>During data load, all the carbondata files are written to local disk and finally copied to the target store location in HDFS/S3. Enabling this parameter will make carbondata files to be written directly onto target HDFS/S3 location bypassing the local disk. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Writing directly to HDFS/S3 saves local disk IO(once for writing the files and again for copying to HDFS/S3) there by improving the performance.

<td>Each CarbonData load will create one segment, if every load is small in size it will generate many small file over a period of time impacting the query performance. This configuration is for minor compaction which decides how many segments to be merged. Configuration is of the form (x,y). Compaction will be triggered for every x segments and form a single level 1 compacted segment. When the number of compacted level 1 segments reach y, compaction will be triggered again to merge them to form a single level 2 segment. For example: If it is set as 2, 3 then minor compaction will be triggered for every 2 segments. 3 is the number of level 1 compacted segments which is further compacted to new segment. <strong>NOTE:</strong> When <em><strong>carbon.enable.auto.load.merge</strong></em> is <strong>true</strong>, configuring higher values cause overall data loading time to increase as compaction will be triggered after data loading is complete but status is not returned till compaction is complete. But compacting more number of segments can increase query performance. Hence optimal values needs to be configured based on the business scenario. Valid values are between 0 to 100.</td>

<td>CarbonData supports DELETE/UPDATE functionality by creating delta data files for existing carbondata files. These delta files would grow as more number of DELETE/UPDATE operations are performed. Compaction of these delta files are termed as horizontal compaction. This configuration is used to turn ON/OFF horizontal compaction. After every DELETE and UPDATE statement, horizontal compaction may occur in case the delta (DELETE/ UPDATE) files becomes more than specified threshold. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Having many delta files will reduce the query performance as scan has to happen on all these files before the final state of data can be decided. Hence it is advisable to keep horizontal compaction enabled and configure reasonable values to <em><strong>carbon.horizontal.UPDATE.compaction.threshold</strong></em> and <em><strong>carbon.horizontal.DELETE.compaction.threshold</strong></em>

<td>Each CarbonData file has a companion CarbonIndex file which maintains the metadata about the data. These CarbonIndex files are read and loaded into driver and is used subsequently for pruning of data during queries. These CarbonIndex files are very small in size(few KB) and are many. Reading many small files from HDFS is not efficient and leads to slow IO performance. Hence these CarbonIndex files belonging to a segment can be combined into  a single file and read once there by increasing the IO throughput. This configuration enables to merge all the CarbonIndex files into a single MergeIndex file upon data loading completion. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Reading a single big file is more efficient in HDFS and IO throughput is very high. Due to this the time needed to load the index files into memory when query is received for the first time on that table is significantly reduced and there by significantly reduces the delay in serving the first query.</td>
